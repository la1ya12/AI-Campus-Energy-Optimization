# Screenshots and Execution Output Explanation

This document explains the screenshots generated during the execution of the
**AI-Based Campus Energy Consumption Insight & Optimization Assistant** project.
These outputs demonstrate how AI-based analysis is applied to identify energy
usage patterns, rank buildings, detect anomalies, and generate insights for
sustainable energy management.

## 1. Raw Energy Data

**Screenshot File:** `raw energy data.png`

This screenshot shows the raw electricity consumption dataset used in the project.
It contains:
- Building name
- Month
- Units of electricity consumed

This data serves as the input for AI-based analysis and represents real-world
campus energy usage scenarios.


## 2. Average Energy Consumption by Building

**Screenshot File:** `average energy consumption by building.png`

This bar graph visualizes the **average electricity consumption** for each campus
building.
- Taller bars indicate higher energy usage.
- Lab_Block shows the highest energy consumption.
- Hostel_A follows next, while Library and Admin_Block have lower usage.

This visualization helps decision-makers quickly identify buildings that require
energy optimization efforts.


## 3. Building Energy Ranking

**Screenshot File:** `building energy ranking.png`

This output ranks campus buildings from **highest to lowest** based on average
electricity consumption:
1. Lab_Block
2. Hostel_A
3. Library
4. Admin_Block

The ranking helps prioritize buildings for energy audits and efficiency improvements.


## 4. Predicted Next Month Energy Usage

**Screenshot File:** `ai energy insights.png`

This screenshot includes AI-generated insights along with estimated future energy
usage.
The system uses historical data trends to provide an approximate prediction for
next month’s electricity consumption, supporting proactive planning.


## 5. AI Energy Insights and Recommendations

**Screenshot File:** `ai energy insights.png`

This output demonstrates the core AI functionality of the project.
Based on detected patterns and anomalies, the system automatically generates:
- High energy usage alerts
- Unusual spike detection messages
- Usage within acceptable limits confirmations

These recommendations are generated without manual intervention, making the
system a decision-support AI solution.

## Summary

The screenshots collectively demonstrate:
- AI-based pattern detection
- Building-wise energy ranking
- Anomaly detection
- Predictive trend analysis
- Explainable sustainability insights

This project supports **SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy** by enabling data-driven
decisions to reduce energy wastage and promote sustainable campus operations.
