# AI-Based Campus Energy Consumption Insight & Optimization Assistant

## Overview
This project uses AI-based data analysis to study electricity consumption across campus buildings.
It identifies high energy usage, detects anomalies, and provides insights to reduce energy wastage
and support sustainable energy practices.

## SDG Alignment
- SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- SDG 13: Climate Action

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions consume large amounts of electricity across hostels, classrooms,
laboratories, and administrative buildings. Due to limited monitoring and lack of intelligent
analysis, energy is often wasted, leading to higher costs and increased carbon emissions.
Manual monitoring is inefficient and not scalable.

## Solution
The system analyzes campus electricity usage data and applies AI-based logic to:
- Detect high energy consumption
- Identify unusual spikes (anomalies)
- Rank buildings by average energy usage
- Predict future energy consumption trends
- Generate explainable energy-saving recommendations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- AI-based Pattern Detection
- Decision-Support AI

## Responsible AI
- Uses aggregated building-level data only
- No personal or sensitive data involved
- Transparent and explainable insights
- Focused on awareness and optimization
